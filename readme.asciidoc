The cover generator is a tool for putting various elements (title, sub-title, etc) on a cover.

== General Specs

* It should use javascript, processing.js or something similar
* It accepts a JSON object that provides default values for the elements.  Here's the a sample:

----
include::covergen_hotspots.js[]
----
	
== The UI

There are two basic parts to the interface.  The *preview* section and the *control* section.  The interface should look roughly like this:

=== The Preview Section

* Displays the various elements at their appropriate sizes.  So, the title element will appear at the specified (x,y) position at the specified font size. 
* The background image should be taken from the cover-template field in the JSON field.
* The cover image will be 600px along its longest side, with a maximum dimensions of 600px x 600px.

For example, the cover image in the preview section will look like this:

image::https://github.com/MakerPress/covergen/raw/master/makerpress_template.png[scaledwidth="90%"]

=== The Control section

* The user should be able to select from among the different imprints in the JSON structure
* The control section should be built dynamically from the JSON
* Allows user to set new values for the various elements.  For example, they should be able to set the values in the "Title" field.
* The user should be able to enter a "\n" in the "text" field to create a linebreak in the title which will be rendered in the "Preview" panel.
* Changes made in the control sections should update the in-memory JSON data structure

== Output

* The user should be able to press the "View Definition" button to see a new version of the JSON with the custom values defined for the selected imprint.
* They should be able to cut-and-paste the new definition values into another file on their OS.
