The cover generator is a tool for putting various elements (title, sub-title, etc) on a cover.  Here are
some specs:
<p>
<ol>
<li>It should use javascript, processing.js or something similar</li>
<li>It accepts a JSON object that provides default values for the elements.  Here's the <a href="covergen_hotspots.js">sample format</a></li>
<li>There are two basic parts to the interface.  The preview section and the control section</li>
<li>The Preview Section</li>
   <ul>
      <li>Displays the various elements at their approiate sizes.  So, the title element will appear at the specified (x,y) position at the specified font size. </li>
     <li> The background image should be taken from the cover-template field in the JSON field.</li>
     <li>The cover image will be 600px along its longest side, with a maximum dimensions of 600px x 600px.</li>
   </ul>
<li>The Control section</li>
   <ul>
      <li>The user should be able to select from among the different imprints in the JSON structure</li>
      <li>The control section should be built dynamically from the JSON</li>
      <li>Allows user to set new values for the various elements.  For example, they should be able to set the values in the "Title" field.</i>
      <li> The user should be able to enter a "\n" in the "text" field to create a linebreak in the title which will be rendered in the "Preview" panel.</li>
      <li>Changes made in the control sections should update the in-memory JSON data structure</li>
   </ul>
<li>The user should be able to press the "View Definition" button to see a new version of the JSON with the custom values defined for the selected imprint.  </li>
<li>They should be able to cut-and-paste th new defintion values into another file on their OS.</li>
</ol>
The system should look something like these basic wireframes:
